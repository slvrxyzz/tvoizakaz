Functional gaps:
- Verification badges, monthly rewards, achievement board: not implemented. Requires dedicated models, scheduled jobs, profile UI updates.
- Portfolio gallery (attachments, achievements board) is partial: current profile lacks media uploads and showcase.
- Ratings & leaderboards absent: need aggregation jobs, endpoints, UI widgets.
- Content workflow moderation is basic; no editor queue or status transitions.
- Auto-moderation for chat messages not present; only manual checks.

Technical gaps:
- No automated cache eviction tests beyond repository unit coverage.
- Missing comprehensive CI: pytest, lint, frontend build not wired.
- Websocket origin validation still TODO; only token checks implemented.

Process / documentation:
- Need refreshed .env guidance (cookie-based auth, NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_LOGIN_DOMAIN).
- Security response procedures for admin SQL console not documented.
